The single-plate shear connection shall be permitted to be used as backing for the CJP groove weld. The thickness of the plate shall be at least a in. (10 mm).

Exception: For IMF, it is permitted to connect the beam web to the column flange using a bolted single-plate shear connection. The bolted single-plate shear connection shall be designed as a slip-critical connection, with the design slip resistance per bolt determined according to the AISC Specification. For seismic loading, the nominal bearing strength at bolt holes shall not be taken greater than the value given by Equation J3-6a of the AISC Specification. The design shear strength of the single-plate shear connection shall be determined based on shear yielding of the gross section and on shear rupture of the net section. The plate shall be welded to the column flange with a CJP groove weld or with fillet welds on both sides of the plate. The minimum size of the fillet weld on each side of the plate shall be 75% of the thickness of the plate. Standard holes shall be provided in the beam web and in the plate, except that short-slotted holes (with the slot parallel to the beam flanges) may be used in either the beam web or in the plate, but not in both.
